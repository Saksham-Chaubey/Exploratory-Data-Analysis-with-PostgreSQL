# Analyzing International Debt Statistics

In our world today, a country may take debt to manage its economy. This is mostly done to cater for major needs of the nation and citizens. The **World Bank** is the organization which is responsible for provision of debt to such countries. 

In this project, I used PostgreSQL to analyze the international debt data gotten from the **[World bank](https://www.worldbank.org)** by answering various pertinent questions.

The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in US Dollars) owed by developing countries across several categories. The SQL queries were run in Jupyter notebook.

### SQL Clauses Used:
`SELECT`, `FROM`, `LIMIT`, `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, `ROUND`, `GROUP BY`, `WHERE` and Subqueries.

**Aggregate functions** such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, and `AVG` were also used.
